I used CRA / JS even though its too much bloat for a simple exercise like this. But Im much faster / comfortable with it, bc I used React for the last year.

clone this repo to local, run npm install if needed.

Thnn, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the program at http://localhost:3000

Just keep playing from there. Have fun!
